## Description
This project contains an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a bootstrap.css file. By Using these files I was able to create my portfolio webpage which consists of the following sections: About Me, Background, My Work, and Hobbies.
I used many different stylings throughout this project, and also created a media query that would allow the website to maintain the same look through a mobile viewport.
