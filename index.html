      <p class="card-text"><span class="name">Hi my name's Adam!</span> I'm 21 years old and love to code. About two years ago I left Half Moon Bay, CA. & moved to Portland, Oregon where I'm trying to grasp a better understanding of not only my coding abilities, but of a healthy lifestyle as well. I love to run, take photos, create videos, wakeboard, and more. I hope that my current enrollment in Epicodus' august course will be a great intro to the next chapter of my career, yet also a place that I'll make new friends, and good memories.

      <p class="card-text"><strong>For my education</strong> I went to school in California and Arizona. I graduated from Junipero Serra Highschool, an all boys Catholic school located in San Mateo, California. After graduating I traveled to Tucson, Arizona where I enrolled at the University of Arizona. I spent a year as a Wildcat at UofA but then felt that it wasn't right for me, and that I needed to do a bit more searching. It was during this time of searching that I came across code, and began to pursue a career in software development! In the past I've worked as a photgrapher for companies, I've made product videos for companies as well as shot music videos for very well-known artists in the rap industry. Doing work this way was fun, yet not very promising. After leaving college I began a software development course at Catalyte in Portland. I undwerwent there training program but didn't feel that it was a company that I'd want to stay at. At 20yrs old I took a break from pursuing code and got a job at a local restaurant, Holy Taco. I started bussing tables, then eventually moved up to becoming a bartender in training. It was right when Covid-19 broke out that finished my training, but ended up unemployed due to the virus. I took this as a sign to leave the restaurant industry and get back to coding, which honestly I had missed for the last year and a half I had been away from it.
