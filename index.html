    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi my name's Adam! I'm 21 years old and love to code. About two years ago I left Half Moon Bay, CA. & moved to Portland, Oregon where I'm trying to grasp a better understanding of not only my coding abilities, but of a healthy lifestyle as well. I love to run, take photos, create videos, wakeboard, and more. I hope that my current enrollment in Epicodus' august course will be a great intro to the next chapter of my career, yet also a place that I'll make new friends, and good memories.
